RPi NFC Secure Entry

This is a tiny home made tool that just monitors the door, detects
users, and sends alerts. In the future it might sound an audible alarm
and take pictures, but I don't have the hardware to test it right now,
so it is what it is.

By default, RPi NFC Security uses GPIO 23 as the signal pin.

Wiring is easy, so long as you have bits of wire, aluminum foil, and
a ~10kOhm resistor for the pull-down. Looks like the following:

POSTITIVE PIN +_______________DOOR SWITCH_
NEGATIVE PIN  -__10kOhm_______DOOR SWITCH_|
SIGNAL PIN    O__________|
